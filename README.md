A hobby OS written in Rust-lang, with only one mission statements: 
> If it can run, it counts!

## Acknowledgements
- Thanks for shakram02 project `HamdOS` for providing the `ps2` and `mouse` files. 
    - I will currently use these files until I can wrap my head around it, and write my own versions.

- Thanks for `https://os.phil-opp.com` to provide incredible tutorials on writing an OS in Rust, and being the ultimate `boilerplate` for this project!
